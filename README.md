# The Zen Life Is SWEETEST

Introduction to Python and other sentient languages. Refresher module.

## About the Repository

What is contained in here are Python projects designed to give a deeper understanding of the language and introduce data structures and algorithms in due time. As it progresses more projects will be added to it in completion of tasks assigned daily. For now, it's Python basics.

## Limitations

As is obvious, there is less freedom and this is not an iPython module. As such, no imports of pandas and other packages are used save plain old Python.
