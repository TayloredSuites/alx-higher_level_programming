# Object Oriented Programming


- ## About the Project

This project leaves proceedure-oriened programming and shifts to oject oriented programming in Python. Classes are a great way to instantiate functions, and if you look at my Kotlin repo, you can see how it works and how powerful it is. There ate public and private classes and ditto for the attributes.

- ## Required Software / Tools

- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Editors used `vi`, `vim` and `emacs` with each file ending in a new line
- All files are executable with first line of `#!/usr/bin/python3`

### Some code requirements
- documentation `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- classes should have a documentation `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`, the above is for modules
- functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
