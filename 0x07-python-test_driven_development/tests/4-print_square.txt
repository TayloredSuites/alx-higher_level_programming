How to Use 4-print_square.py

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``print_square()``.

Numbers
=======

``print_square()`` returns a square with the character # of a given size.

::

    >>> from 4-prnt_square import print_square
    >>> print_square(3)
    ###
    ###
    ###

    >>> print_square(5)
    #####
    #####
    #####
    #####
    #####

    >>> print_square(0)
    ''

Other Unwanted Cases
====================

Because ``print_square()`` is defined on positive integers only,
``print_square()`` does not work if the size is a negative number,
or is equal to zero (integer or float). It will raise a TypeError in such instances

::

    >>> print_error(-1)
    ValueError: size must be >= 0

    >>> print_square(-25.0)
    TypeError: size must be an integer

    >>> print_square("Yakata!")
    TypeError: size must be an integer
