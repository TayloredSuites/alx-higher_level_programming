How to Use 5-text_indentation.txt

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``text_indentation()``.

Normal Characters Accepted
==========================

``text_indentation()`` returns two newlines whenever forbidden characters are
encountered. Text accepted must be a string. Once it is not a fullstop,
colon or question mark, expect the below behaviour

::

    >>> from 5-text_indentation import text_indentation
    >>> text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing"
    >>> text_indentation(text)
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing

    >>> text = "What is going on Gandalf? Let us go, or else. Yikes\!"
    >>> text_indentation(text)
    What is going on Gandalf?

    Let us go, or else.

    Yikes!

Non-text Entry
====================

Because ``text_indentation()`` is defined on strings only. It will not pick out
the three special characters if the input is not a string. It will raise a
TypeError in such instances

::

    >>> text = 34289384
    >>> text_indentation(text)
    TypeError: text must be a string
