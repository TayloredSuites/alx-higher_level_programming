 How to Use 0-add_integer.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``add_integer()``.

Numbers
=======

``add_integer()`` returns the sum of its arguments.  For numbers,
that value is equivalent to using the ``+`` operator.

::

    >>> from 0-add_integer import add_integer
    >>> my_function(2, 3)
    5
    >>> my_function(1, -2)
    -1

It also works with floating-point values

::

    >>> my_function(2.0, -3)
    -1.0


Non-Numbers
===========

Because ``+`` is also defined on data types other than numbers,
``add_integer()`` works just as well if one of the arguments is a
string, a list, or a tuple. However, it will raise a TypeError

::

    >>> my_function('a', 3)
    TypeError: a must be an integer

    >>> my_function(6.2, 'Hello')
    TypeError: b must be an integer
