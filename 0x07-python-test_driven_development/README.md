# Testing

- ## About the Project

Testing is of great importance to the software engineer. It is the only way to ascertain code is able to meet up with client requirements and be functional at the same time. There are a wide variety of tests, some of which are alpha (unit testing, system testing and integration testing (bottom-up and top-down)), beta, regression, acceptance, non-functional teseting (usability, security, portability), test planning, etc. A Google search will show you more.

In Python, more common tests are carried out with packages such as unittest and doctest from the CLI.

```python

def this_is_a_function(unittest_conditions):
	"""
	>>> this_is_a_function(i, j)
	ANS
	"""

	return result

```
