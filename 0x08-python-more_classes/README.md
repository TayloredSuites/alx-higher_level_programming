# More Classes and Objects

- ## About the Project

This project aims at digging deeper into python classes by dealing with a rectangle class and building objects into it, until it can define a  rectangle in the true sense of its entirety. Expect more class and instance attributes, class methods and statements, properties vs. getters and setters, str vs. repr, etc. It may touch on abstraction and encapsulation, information hiding, etc.

- All python files will start by running Python, i.e. `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Ubunty 20.04 LTS on Python 3.8.5
